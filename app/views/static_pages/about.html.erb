Ranging from Grade 4 Science Teachers to High School English teachers, our team is powered by innovative professionals who are passionate about the merging of literacy and technology. More needs to be done to equip our children with life-skills and learning-habits for an unpredictable future, and Sparked teachers know how to foster independent, caring, resilient creators.</p>

They literally get giddy when helping someone check-out the right Git Branch or finding a more "elegant" and DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself!) version of your code. Poets much? And Sparked's community of Web Developers is growing on the principle that there's so much heart- and brain-power out there that simply wants to help you. When looking for Developers to Tutor and run Workshops, it matters less about which prestigious University program you attended than how well you create and help others create.</p>

The word, not the concept. See, the left and right hemispheres of the brain process information in different ways. Learners usually process information using the dominant brain hemisphere. However, the learning process is greatly enhanced when all of the senses are used. This includes using the less dominate hemisphere.</p>

A brilliant elementary teacher in Toronto, Brian is renowned for creating inclusive, uplifting, and enduring communities. He is also currently in the home-stretch of his Masters in Education at OISE, where he is practicing discovery-based learning strategies. Brian crafts entire units and courses that don't feel like school or Ontario Curriculum because of how fun they are -- and that's why he's drawn to the power of coding.</p>
